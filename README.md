# Macroeconomic Implications of oil prices on net oil importing and exporting emerging economies: Case of Latin America

## Description

The main goal of this study is to examine and compare the implications of oil prices on the economic activity of net oil importers and exporters of emerging markets in Latin America. The data for this study will cover a period of 20 years from 2000 to 2020. The univariate time series macroeconomic variables considered for this study are Oil prices, GDP growth rate, consumer price index (a proxy for inflation), interest rate, real exchange rate, unemployment rate, and other indicators. 
The study will constructing an ordinary least squares (OLS), the vector autoregression (VAR) for multivariate time series analysis will be implemented. In addition, the study uses the Granger causality test (Granger, 1969) to examine whether the past values of oil prices can predict the current changes in economic growth. The study also use the vector error correction model (VECM) (Engle & Granger, 1987)examine the speed and magnitude of adjustment to equilibrium between oil price and economic growth. Moreover, the study will employ a structural vector autoregression (SVAR) proposed by (Blanchard & Quah, 1989) in order to examine the effects of oil prices shocks on the macroeconomic variables of these economies,
